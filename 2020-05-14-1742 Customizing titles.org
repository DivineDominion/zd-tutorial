Backlink: ยง2020-05-13-1815 Customizing Zetteldeft

When creating a new note, Zetteldeft will insert the =zetteldeft-title-prefix= string, which is Org-mode's =#+TITLE:= by default.

This string is also used when you rename notes with =zetteldeft-file-rename=.

For Markdown (ยง2020-04-17-1532), set it =#=.
Don't forget to include a space at the end of the string.

A note's title is appended by the =zetteldeft-title-suffix= string (but is empty by default).
If you customize this, don't forget to add =\n= at the beginning to start a new line.

I use 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq zetteldeft-title-suffix "\n# Tags #")
#+end_src

This way, that I am reminded to include tags.
