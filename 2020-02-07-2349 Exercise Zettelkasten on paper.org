I encourage everyone who tries to implement a Zettelkasten type of note taking system to do the following exercise, a way to get a different feel of it.

1. Take a small notepad, preferably with disposable pages
2. Number the first 20 pages
3. Title page 1 "Overview"
4. Start writing todo's & notes on the subsequent pages
5. Each time you add a note, add a link to your "Overview" on page 1

Of course this is not a Zettelkasten system, but an exercise like this underscores both how easy it is to get started with a note-taking system like this, and how powerful such a plain approach is.
