Starting from =deft=, a Zettelkasten system needs:
 - links between notes that are easy to make and easy to follow
 - a system for =#tags= and a way to generate an index

What would be handy:
 - auto completion for links to other notes
 - a generated list of tags, perhaps with auto-completion

Importantly, the Zettelkasten should
 - be human readable
 - prevent lock-in
